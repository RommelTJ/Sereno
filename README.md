# Sereno

**v0.0.1**

A private, LAN-only personal finance tracker for two people. No auth, no cloud, no bank
integrations — just a calm, queryable picture of your money: net worth month over month,
a Simple-Bank-style "Safe-to-spend" number, and a longevity forecast that answers the
question that actually matters: **does the money last?**

Sereno replaces a column-growing spreadsheet with a **row-growing, append-only database**.
Every balance, expense, and assumption is an effective-dated row — never updated, only
appended — so you can diff any two dates, replay history, and let an AI agent query the
whole thing in plain SQL.

## Features

### Track

- **Net worth dashboard** — at-a-glance hero number with year-over-year change and a
  monthly sparkline, computed live from every account and liability.
- **Ledger entries** — one row per month per account. Enter fund balances, retirement,
  and ETH holdings (quantity × price auto-translates to USD); the latest entry in a month
  wins, and earlier rows are kept as history.
- **Safe-to-spend** — total cash − bills due − money in funds. Monthly category envelopes
  with progress bars; overspending is allowed and simply reduces the headline number.
- **Funds & goals** — sinking funds and dated goals as one concept. Notes are
  auto-derived, never hand-typed: "needs $X/mo to finish by June", "~2 yrs to target",
  "fully funded".

### Plan

- **Spending guardrails** — Guyton-Klinger withdrawal-rate bands (Cut / Hold / Raise)
  around your at-retirement anchor rate, with a live spend slider and explicit
  raise/cut trigger portfolios.
- **Withdrawal sourcing** — a tax-aware sequencing waterfall: fill the spending gap from
  ETH first inside the 0% long-term-capital-gains headroom, then taxable brokerage, then
  401(k) after 59½. Solves for *net spendable*, not a naive 4%-per-bucket draw.
- **Longevity forecast** — a year-by-year simulation from age 38 to 95, charted by bucket
  (ETH, brokerage, 401(k), Social Security). Verdict up front: "You don't run out" or
  "Lasts to age N", plus a sensitivity table across spend levels and live sliders for
  return, inflation, and Social Security assumptions.

## Design principles

1. **Append-only.** Never `UPDATE` a balance; insert a new dated row.
2. **Effective-dated.** Every fact carries a date, so any month can be reconstructed.
3. **Tidy long.** One fact per row. Months are rows, never columns.
4. **AI-queryable.** The schema separates dimensions (what things are), facts (what
   happened), and config (each year's tax and forecast assumptions), so an agent can
   answer "what changed, and when?" straight from SQL.

## Status

v0.0.1 — project initialization. The data model and high-fidelity designs are complete;
implementation is next, roughly in this order:

1. Database schema and seed data
2. App shell, navigation, and dashboard
3. Ledger entry and monthly net-worth views
4. Safe-to-spend, envelopes, and spending/funding entry
5. Funds & goals
6. Guardrails → withdrawal sourcing engine → longevity forecast
